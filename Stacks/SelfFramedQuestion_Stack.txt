A class has a limited seating capacity of 5 students.  Students are seated in the class in order of their arrival. If the professor in the class decides to reduce the class size by removing students and he does so by removing students who arrived into the class last. Eg if 5 students are seated and he wants to reduce the class size to 4, the student who came to the class is asked to exit and so on. The professor can also add students to the class provided he does not the exceed the class seating capacity of 5. Write a JAVA program using stacks to implement the above use case.
