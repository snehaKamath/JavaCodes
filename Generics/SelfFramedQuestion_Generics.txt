Assume you want to implement a google map prototype. Your prototype takes as input the address in any of the following formats:
-> longitude, longitude
-> street name, street name intersection
-> state name, pin code
The server has to receive the data in its actual datatype. Eg longitude, longitude=double, double.
street name, street name intersection = string, string. State name, pin code = string, integer.
However, you need to write a single class which accepts these inputs. Write a java program using generics to implement the above use case.
